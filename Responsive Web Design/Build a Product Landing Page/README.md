# Build a Product Landing Page

### Objective:
Build an app that is functionally similar to [https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks](https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks).

---

### User Stories:

1. Your product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`.

2. You can see an `img` element within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here).

3. Within the `#header` element, you can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`.

4. You can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`.

5. When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

6. You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.

7. Your landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`.

8. Within the form, there is an `input` field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address.

9. The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for.

10. The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

11. Within the form, there is a `submit` input with a corresponding `id="submit"`.

12. When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: [https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit](https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)).

13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

14. Your product landing page should have at least one media query.

15. Your product landing page should utilize CSS Flexbox at least once.
